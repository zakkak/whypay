<h2 class="page-header"><a name="supported-by"></a> Where did it come from?</h2>

<div class="row">
  <div class="span8 offset4">
    <p><strong>WhyPAY?</strong>Is a fork of <strong>Where Does My
    Money Go?</strong>, which was first developed as an idea by
    the <a href="http://www.okfn.org">Open Knowledge
    Foundation</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.jonathangray.org">Jonathan
    Gray</a> in 2007.</p>

    <p>In November 2008 the project was a winner of the UK
    Government&#8217;s <a href="http://www.showusabetterway.co.uk/">Show
    Us a Better Way</a> competition. The project received a small
    grant in summer 2009 from the UK Government to develop a
    prototype, which was launched in autumn 2009. In 2010 the project
    received funding from Channel
    4&#8242;s <a href="http://www.4ip.org.uk/">4iP</a> to support
    further development.</p>

<h2 class="page-header">Who is behind this?</h2>

<div class="row">
  <div class="span8 offset4">
    <p>The formal answer is the <a href="http://www.okfn.org/">Open
    Knowledge Foundation</a> who created and are running the
    project. The OKF is a not-for-profit organization dedicating to
    making information <a href="http://opendefinition.org/">open</a>
    &#8212; available for anyone to access and re-use.</p>

    <p>However the more informal, and perhaps more accurate, answer
    is: <strong>you!</strong>. This is citizen-driven project not only
    in the sense that citizens like yourself will be its users, but to
    gather and analyse the data we are going
    to <a href="/get-involved/">need your help to do it</a>.</p>

<h2 class="page-header">Is there a party political motivation behind this project?</h2>
<div class="row">
  <div class="span8 offset4">
    <p><strong>WhyPAY</strong> is a free, impartial, politically
    neutral, online tool to find out about where public money in Greece
    is spent. There is no party political motivation behind this
    project. The project does not aim to present any one particular
    narrative about the Greek Government&#8217;s income or expenditure,
    or where money should and shouldn&#8217;t be spent. Our main aim
    is to help members of the public understand where public money is
    spent, not to comment on how it is spent. We hope it will be a
    useful tool for everyone, regardless of their political persuasion
    and their views on public spending.</p>

<h2 class="page-header">Why are you doing this?</h2>

<div class="row">

    <p>You can read more about this in our original proposal for the project:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>FIXME: The British public have exceptional access to official
      documents and datasets detailing the operations of the official
      institutions around them. UKOP have catalogued 450,000 post-1980
      records from over 2000 public bodies. Portals such as Directgov
      and National Statistics Online, in addition to the plethora of
      central, regional and local government department websites, can
      furnish the layperson with a vast and diverse body of
      knowledge. However, the time and effort required to learn where
      to look for different pieces of information, and how to
      interpret what is found, may be substantial, and potentially
      off-putting.</p>

      <p>A time-tested way of making large, complex bodies of ideas
      manageable is by representing them visually &#8212; whether in
      the form of maps, timelines, graphs, or charts. Visual
      representations, as aids, range from the exemplary practice of
      Harry Beck&#8217;s London tube map to the ubiquitous line graph
      used to supplement words in an essay or
      presentation. Visualisations combining different kinds of data
      are often used in the printed and televised media to illustrate
      broad patterns and trends &#8212; such as the animated graphics
      that accompany the BBC&#8217;s election coverage.</p>

      <p>Recent developments in internet technologies over the past
      few years make it feasible to build an online visualization
      service which would help citizens to find, explore, understand
      and re-use data made available by the government. Instead of
      visualizations generated by others to illustrate particular
      reports, data could be displayed in accordance with the
      interests of the user. Hence the user could see data from their
      region in national context, grasp the background to specific
      policies relevant to them more concretely and posit trends and
      patterns for themselves. The service would allow citizens to
      navigate through and engage with government information on their
      own terms by helping them to generate visual representations for
      themselves, by themselves.</p>

      <p>We propose to initially focus on economic data. It would be
      an excellent basis for such a service for two reasons. Firstly,
      a great abundance of such information exists &#8212; every
      government office, department and council regularly publishes
      their accounts &#8212; and it is difficult to get an overview of
      where money is coming from and going. So, visual representations
      would be particularly useful in this area. Secondly, every
      citizen has economic transactions with the government, whether
      outgoing in the form of council or income taxation, or incoming
      in the form of benefits, allowances, loans or grants. So, these
      representations would have widespread tangible relevance.</p>

      <p>Users of the service would be able to see where their own
      money is spent or where it comes from, as well as where money
      across government is spent and where it comes from. Existing
      government transparency would be built upon to help citizens
      discover their own part in government economic activity &#8212;
      thereby encouraging them to take a more active interest in, and
      a more thoroughly informed engagement with, the official
      institutions around them.</p>
